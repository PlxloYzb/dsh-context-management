/**
 * RQ2 engine finding — batch multi-range compression at the protected-zone
 * boundary. Observed live (twice, deterministic): a single compress call
 * with three disjoint ranges — each valid alone against the original
 * surface, together covering the compressible span up to the protected
 * zone — was rejected wholesale with "Range is entirely within the
 * protected zone" naming the LAST entry's messages, while the same three
 * ranges compressed one-per-turn all succeeded. Root cause (located offline
 * via research/scripts/debug-rq2-batch-replay.mts against the exported live
 * fixture): the kernel's preserveRecentTokens tail walk over a tail of tiny
 * acknowledgments reached two ranges deep, and a batch call freezes the
 * tail at call time. Fixed in 0.2.0-beta.5: handleCompress applies ranges
 * sequentially, landing each durable checkpoint before the next range's
 * protected-zone computation (see tests/batch-compress-sequential.test.ts
 * for the fixture replay and the preserved batch semantics).
 *
 * This test pins the offline boundary contract after the fix: a batch whose
 * last range only PARTIALLY intersects the protected zone still lands every
 * range (the kernel excludes the protected messages with a warning instead
 * of rejecting), matching the one-per-turn outcome.
