/**
 * dsh-context-management preset bridge — replace a mounted preset's official Basic
 * compaction backend with ARC inside its original service realm, through
 * official Loader patch semantics and zero file writes.
 *
 * Mechanism (every step is a public, documented Loader/Include behavior):
 *
 *  1. the bridge row (inserted by this package's `cordis.patch.yml` bundle
 *     layer) registers the engine class in the Loader's public builtin
 *     registry, the same registry app-boot itself uses for `cordis:group`;
 *  2. on every `agent/created`, the standing preset mount of the agent's
 *     scope is located through the public `standingMountFor()` export of
 *     `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-presets`;
 *  3. the mount's Include config gains runtime patches — disable the
 *     `compaction-basic` row (guarded by its official package name) and
 *     insert the ARC engine row into the unchanged `compaction` isolate
 *     group — then `fiber.update(config, true)` re-reads the composition,
 *     re-applies the patches, and reconciles the tree transactionally;
 *  4. the group keeps its `isolate: { compaction: true }` realm, so the ARC
 *     engine provides `ctx.compaction` exactly where Basic did and the
 *     sibling rows (`command-compact`, `tool-result-pruner`) rebind to it
 *     without any change of their own.
 *
 * Nothing is ever written to disk: preset files, row ids, group nesting, and
 * user patches stay byte-identical, and both uninstall and a plain restart
 * remount the untouched original composition. The fiber mutation is owned by
 * a Cordis effect whose reverse update restores the original Include config
 * (the same transactional re-apply, run backwards).
 *
